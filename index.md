## About Me

I am currently working as a PhD student at the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Imperial College London, under the supervision of Dr. Wei Dai in Communications and Signal Processing Research Group. Previously, I have worked as a Research Associate at Center of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Science (CACTuS) Lab at Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore, Pakistan. I have graduated with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) in 2019 with a specialisation in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. Prior to that, I have completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore in 2017. blah.

My research interests include applications in statistical signal processing, inverse problems in imaging, deep learning based image reconstruction, and convex optimisation methods for learning low-rank and sparse representations of signals.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Statistical signal processing, inverse problems, convex optimisation methods, low-rank and sparse representations
- **Machine Learning:** Deep learning, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, generative models
